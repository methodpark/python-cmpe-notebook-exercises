    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a word for word translation dictionary, create a translate function that applies that profound knowledge to inputs in english.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read in the file, a variable with the file name is provided.\n",
    "1. Find out the format.\n",
    "1. Convert the contents of the file to a dictionary.\n",
    "1. Write a function that takes a string, splits it into words, translates and makes a string again.\n",
    "1. Use docstrings and at least one doctestâ€”where applicable!\n",
    "1. Write [unit tests](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preferrably points 1 and 2 in one function\n",
    "- Think about where/how you keep your data, especially wrt. to unit tests.\n",
    "- You don't have to think about letter case, but you may.\n",
    "- Punctuation is just skipped over, but it should appear in the output.\n",
    "- Words missing in the dictionary should be kept as is. But you might [extend the dictionary](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html?highlight=chainmap#chainmap-objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stretch Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- Also find words with different letter case.\n",
    "- Accept a marker word that is displayed for every missing word.\n",
    "- Provide a list of missing words for the translators to work on.\n",
    "\n",
